`npm` manages project dependencies as well as meta data about the project in a
file called `package.json`. The easiest way to create this file is to run
`npm init`: It will ask you a series of questions and generate a `package.json`
file to get you started. For the "entry point" question use the name of your
project. i.e. `meadowlark.js`.

Every time you run npm you'll get warnings unless you provide a repository URL
in `package.json` and a nonempty README file.
